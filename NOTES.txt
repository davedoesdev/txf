Sender should do: PUT /default/foo/hmac-of-foo
- Checks the hmac matches first then waits until there is a GET of /foo

Receiver should do: GET /default/foo/hmac-of-foo
- Checks the hmac matches first then waits until there is a PUT of /foo

When there is both a PUT and GET of /default/foo, pipes the sender to the
receiver.

hmac secrets should be passed in.

Allow clients to timeout, up to them to retry.


Reason for the hmac is you must have the secret OR been given a URL generated
by someone with the secret. A receiver who has been sent a single URL cannot
then send or receiver other files without the secret.
There are two secrets per namespace (/default here) - one for sending and one
for receiving.

OpenShift can set custom environment variables (rhc env set) so could use that
to set the hmac.
On Travis/Semaphore/Circle we can do the same or use encrypted files.
